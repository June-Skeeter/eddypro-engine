    - Fixed: bug that was causing storage fluxes to be identically zero in most
        use cases.
    - Fixed: file in src_common was importing module rp-related (did not cause
        computation issues).

        * Minimum sonic temperature set to -40 C (was -20 C).
        * Maximum CO2 set to 900 ppm (was 600 ppm).
    - Refinement: fixes to ranges of accepted biomet values:
        * Changed minimum ambient pressure to 40 kPa (was 80 kPa).
        * Made all interval min/max closed instead of open,
          most important for RH, to include values 0 and 100.

    - Fixed: bug causing the spectral assessment to fail if a large number of spectra
        files were to be used.
    - Refinement: changed units of ET fluxes in the full output file. New units is

    Minor update that fixes a GUI bug related to the retrieval of declination correction
    for magnetic north from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA) website. The update corrects an error that occurs when the website is
    unavailable.

4.2.0 (2013-08-22)
    For a complete list of new features see:
    http://envsupport.licor.com/help/EddyPro4/Default.htm#Whats_New.htm

4.1.0 (2012-11-01)
      For a complete list of new features see:
      http://envsupport.licor.com/help/EddyPro4/Default.htm#Whats_New.htm

    - New features
      - A new spectral correction scheme based on Fratini et al. (2012),
        specifically designed for closed-path systems, but applicable to any EC setup.
      - A new angle-of-attack correction algorithm, implemented after Nakai and
        Shimoyama (2012).

    - Improvements
      - Usage of "previous results" to dramatically reduce program execution time.
      - Binary SLT files containing more than 6 variables can now be processed with
        EddyPro.
      - Usage of external biomet data files, not anymore limited to 18,000 data records.
        In version 4.1, biomet files can contain any number of data records.
      - Express processing uses the new angle-of-attack correction algorithm from
        Nakai and Shimoyama (2012) rather than the correction from Nakai et al. (2006)
        used in previous versions.

    - Major bug fixes
      - Automatic time lag optimization
        - Bug description
          The bug is found in the "Automatic time lag optimization" procedure
          (Advanced Settings >> Processing Options >> Time lag compensation"). The bug
          is such that time lags assessed for H2O (if this gas is treated in flux
          computation) are erroneously used also for CO2 or CH4. Selection of an
          erroneous time lag results in flux underestimates: the more the used time
          lag deviates from the real one, the more fluxes are underestimated.
        - Who is affected
          Anyone who used the "Automatic time lag optimization" option for flux
          computation is likely to be affected. However, the severity of the effects
          changes according to the gas analyzer in use. For open-path analyzers (e.g.,
          LI-7500A), the bias if most likely negligible, if present at all. For
          enclosed-path analyzers (e.g., LI-7200), the bias is probably detectable but
          still negligible, because time lags of H2O do not deviate dramatically from
          those of CO2, especially if conditions of low relative humidity (<50-60%,
          typical of daytime). In these analyzers, effects are further minimized
          if a short (< 1 m) and/or heated or insulated sampling line was used. For
          closed-path analyzers with sampling lines longer than 2 m (e.g., with an
          LI-7000 or an LI-6262), the effects are likely to be relevant and we thus
          recommend to recalculate fluxes using version 4.1.
        - Who is not affected
          All users who ran EddyPro in "Express mode", or those who did not use the
          "Automatic timelag optimization" option are not affected by this bug.
        - Note
          We recommend using the "Automatic timelag optimization" procedure especially for
          closed-path setups featuring medium and long (> 3-4 m) sampling lines. The bug
          notified here was fixed and the correct procedure is available in this release
          (EddyPro 4.1).

      - Calculation of average CH4 mole fractions and mixing ratios from LI-7700
        - Bug description
          Fixed a bug that caused the band-broadening correction to not get applied in the
          calculation of average CH4 concentrations. Note that this did not affect fluxes
          at any extent, as the band-broadening correction was applied on fluxes
          separately in 4.0. The effects of this bug were visible especially in conditions
          of very low ambient pressure with respect to normal values.

    - Other bug fixes
      - Fixed bug that caused the program to crash when the number of files selected for
        planar fit calculations were more than the maximum allowed (3,000). The bug was
        fixed and this maximum value was increased to 18,000.
      - Fixed bug that caused the calculation of maximal wind speed to fail in case of
        existence of any raw data records with at least one wind components set to -9999
        (EddyPro's internal error code). Most often this bug resulted in a maximal wind
        speed of 17318.7 m/s, that was the result of wind speed calculated from 3 wind
        components set to -9999. This bug had no affect on flux results.
      - Fixed bug that caused the cross-wind correction of sonic temperature to be
        calculated erroneously for individual data records that have any wind component
        set to -9999. This bug resulted in implausible values for sonic temperature and
        thus either in fluxes set to -9999, or to extremely spiky fluxes. Note that for
        most anemometers the cross-wind correction is applied in the firmware, so there
        is no need to apply it at processing time with EddyPro.
      - Fixed bug that caused the header of the "full output" file to be erroneous when
        using the option "Use standard output format".
      - Fixed bug that caused the night-time/daytime indication in the "full output" file
        to fail in some circumstances.
      - Fixed a bug in the Random uncertainty estimate that caused the software to
        crash with an "Out of memory" error message.

    - GUI changes
      - Added a general "Restore Default Values" button to restore all the Advanced
        Settings to the Default (express) Settings.
      - Added many constraints between fields to help fill out the Metadata File Editor
        tables.
      - Improved management of previous versions of Project and Metadata files for
        backward compatibility.
      - Added a Software Version field in the Metadata File Editor IRGA table.
      - Added an automatic "Detect Dataset Dates" button for the raw data files.
      - Prevented wheel mouse scrolling on setting controls.
      - Improved management at low resolution displays.
      - Added automatic saving on sub-dialogs exit.
      - Fixed opening associated .eddypro project files when double clicking the file.
      - Added button to clear the output console.
      - Improved guided mode information messages.
      - Fixed many minor GUI bugs.

4.0.0 (2012-04-25)

        from ancillary sensors.
      - Metadata Retriever tool to compile all site metadata from GHG files
        into a single metadata file that can be edited or viewed.
      - Planar Fit tool customization with graphical controls.
      - Time Lag Optimization tool now supports automatic time lag optimization
        to account for time lags.
      - Random Uncertainty estimation tool.

3.0.1 (2012-03-12, not released)
    - Major bug fixes
      - Kljun et al. 2004 footprint estimation: Previous version used
        measurement height (z). Update uses the difference between the measurement
        height and displacement height (z-d).
      - Initialization of latitude, longitude and altitude when using
        dynamic metadata file.
      - Sampling line flow-rate calculation when average flow rate from
        high-frequency data is used to initialize nominal, minimum and maximum
        time lags.
      - Spectral assessment output file when selected correction method is
        Horst (1997).
      - A bug prevented runs without any spectral corrections applied.
      - Refined handling of the "Select a subperiod" option.
      - GUI dialog windows. Users in the previous version could potentially
        loose settings in the dialog windows. When a user clicks on a button
        to enter data, such as "Settings..." next to Generic binary, they can
        enter their data, save the project, close the project, re-open it,
        re-open the widget and their data will not be visible in the GUI. The
        data is still there but not appearing. If the user saves the project, the
        information will be overwritten. If they select cancel, it will remain as
        it was before.
      - Improved project and data selection pages by adding page splitters.
      - Fixed behavior with the cross-wind correction checkbox in relation to
        being properly deactivated with the Master Anemometer in data selection
        page.
      - Improved multiple items in the raw file description. The measurement type
        "Molar Density" was changed to "Molar/Mass Density." The option "Raw File
        Settings" is now deactivated when SLT file types are selected. The algorithm
        for detection of valid minimum variable settings was corrected for "Speed
        of Sound." The saving and reloading of the correct field separator values
        was fixed.
      - Fixed and improved multiple items in the advanced settings. The [%] unit
        was removed from the "Steadiness of Horizontal Wind" feature. Under the
        processing options, the behavior of the widgets for "compensate density
        fluctuations" and "add instrument sensible heat components" was corrected
        to gray and disabled when appropriate.
      - Fixed the error label default number to correctly display in the project
        file as -9999. (Advanced settings/output files).
      - Fixed the default setting under Advanced Settings/Output Files so "Build
        continuous dataset" is unchecked.
      - Match the default unchecked state of Metadata output checkbox with
        project file setting and remove the incorrect association with Full Output.
      - Fixed incomplete offline help system.
      - Fixed the Guided mode for the Metadata File Editor algorithm to properly
        assess the fixed unit of measurement for both input and output
        relationships.

3.0.0 (2012-02-06)
    - Final official release of introducing the Advanced Settings.

3.0.0 Beta (2011-12-14)
    - First public release of 3.0 Beta. This version introduces the Advanced Settings.

2.3.0 (2011-07-20)
    - Major bug fixes
      - An error occurred in the calculation of corrected fluxes if the
        N2O analyzer was a closed-path one, while the CH4 analyzer was open-path
        or CH4 was not present at all. The bug resulted in corrected fluxes of
        N2O equal to -9999 (that is, if your N2O fluxes are not -9999, they are
        not affected by this bug).
      - Definition of "relative separations". No impact on calculations,
        only on the output metadata.
      - Control on use of cell temperature (fixed re-initialization of column
        information)
      - In statistical tests (Spike count/removal and Amplitude Resolution/Drop
        Out) length of implied windows modified so as to scale with the length
        of the averaging period.
    - Improvements
      - Handling of situations where H2O readings are not available
        (air density, momentum flux).
      - Control over peculiar situations in Fluxes23 (WPL section).
      - Introduced support for TOB1 format "FP2"
      - Introduced detection of very implausible values in the raw
        files, and their substitution with error codes.
      - Error codes in raw files (-9999) are no longer modified
        during conversions of raw units into EddyPro units
      - Better handling of situation when all GHG files have invalid
        metadata or are corrupted.
      - Better handling of the computations exit codes

2.2.0 (2011-06-20)
    - Major bug fixes
      - Fixed bug concerning fluxes calculated from CH4 and N2O mole fraction
        measurements from closed path systems. The bug affected also fluxes
        calculated with CO2 mole fractions, if the paired H2O was measured as
        either molar density or mixing ratio. In all cases, the bug resulted
        in flux values =-9999 (that is, if your fluxes are not -9999, they
        are not affected by this bug).
      - Fixed Altitude field zeroing in the Metadata editor.
      - Changed the docking policies of the Tips dock: now it's movable and
        floatable top and bottom and it could also be tabbed with the Console.
      - Changed the dimension policy of the Tips dock: now it's expandable.
      - Fixed misspellings.
      - Used native dialog for the 'Save metadata as' button.
      - GUI code cleaned up.

      - Fixed the SoS to temperature conversion.
      - More detailed diagnostic on the metadata file validation at console.
      - Quality flags recalculated according to Mauder and Foken (2004), which
        should eliminate most (possibly not all) the -9999 in the quality flags
      - Added CHANGELOG.txt to source and installer packages.

2.1.2 (2011-05-18, not released)
      - Fixed problem of Access denied authorization during the processing of the
        data.

2.1.1 (2011-04-26)
    - Fixed typo about the unit of measure of the Raw Data Description table
      (umol/mol^3, instead of umol/m^3).

2.1.0 (2011-04-21)
    - Optimized GUI for support low resolution screens (up to 800x600 px).
