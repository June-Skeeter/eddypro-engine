5.2.0 (2014-11-20)

    Engine
    - Added: Analytic spectra correction after Massman (2000, 2001).
    - Added: Now biomet outputs are provided also for periods when
      corresponding high-frequency data are not available or are corrupted.
    - Added: eddypro_rp now edits .eddypro file, so that eddypro_fcc can be
      launched when eddypro_rp completes, without further interventions.
      This improves portability and facilitate usages from command line and
      automation.
    - Added: option to run engine with command-line specificied .eddypro
      file (full path). See help for usage (run "$eddypro_rp -h")
    - Fixed: bug causing off-season uptake correction to switch to
      'simple linear' and stick there, if radiation measurements were
      missing for just one half-hour.
    - Fixed: management of external biomet files (1 file, files in folder,
      1 minute time-step).
    - Fixed: bug causing TOB1 files without header (rare case) to be deleted
      from the data folder, if they happened to contain less data than expected.
    - Fixed: bug causing soil temperature not to be duly treated as a
      biomet variable.
    - Fixed: call to CorrectionFactorsIbrom07 in BPCF_Fratini12. The wrong call
      prevented use of backup solution (Ibrom model) in periods of too-low
      fluxes. So, the correction was always using the direct method of
      Fratini et al. 2012, also in low-flux conditions.
    - Fixed: functioning of metadata retriever, that got broken after
      refactoring for 5.0.
    - Fixed: bug in footprint model of Kormann and Meixner 2001, as implemented
      in 'eddypro_fcc' (no corresponding bug in 'eddypro_rp')
    - Fixed: missing exception could cause timelag optimization to associate a
      timelag instances to first RH class, which were erroneous. The problem 
      would occur if, for a given period, not enough H2O data were available.
    - Fixed: bug causing cross-wind correction to be applied to
      'fast temperature' measurements, but only if those were used in
      conjunction with an R2 anemometer.
    - Fixed: exit condition for subs importing ASCII data. Was crashing in some
      conditions, if a file contained more records than expected.
    - Fixed: module call to m_common_global_var in RenameTmpFilesCommon.
      The bug was not causing problems because the same module is called by
      the module that was mistakenly called.
    - Fixed: duplicated biomet outputs when raw biomet data are missing.
    - Refinement: eliminated squared root operating on the transfer function H,
      in Fratini et al. (2012) spectral correction method. This refinement
      shall be made publicly available in the form of a corrigendum to the
      paper. Thanks a lot to Johannes Laubach for suggesting the change,
      demonstrating its foundation and verifying the new implementation in
      EddyPro.
    - Refinement: minimum timelag searching window for H2O in timelag optimizer
      reduced from +/-0.7s to +/-0.3s, which fits better to short-tube set-ups.
    - Refinement: refined format of GHG-Europe output file after
      specifications from European Database managers:
        * Eliminated date/time columns: now only ISOdate remains as a timestamp
        * Eliminated WS and WD
        * Eliminated raw file name from output strings
        * Eliminated Pa, Ta, RH from file to avoid conflicts with meteo files
        * Added ISO basic format timestamp
    - Refinement: in timelag optimization session and in main raw data
      processing session, moved call to retrieve_sensor_params before time-lag
      estimations to have instruments properties available for refined
      "starting time-lags" definition.
    - Refinement: moved 'normal exit instruction' in all subs importing raw data,
      in such a way that the exception of reaching the end of the file is caught
      in most (possibly all) occasions.
    - Refinement: implementation of random error after Finkelstein and
      Sims (2001):
        * Improved code quality and readability.
        * Improved speed in calculating the ITS.
    - Refinement: revised retrieval of files in list, to safely skip files that
      do not comply the raw file name format.
    - Refinement: eliminated N = N - 1 at the end of sub ReadSLTEddySoft.
    - Refinement: completely rewritten subroutine to import full cospectra and
      modified approach in FCC to get the size of cospectra from the first file
      instead of allocating in advance.
    - Refinement: improved control over missing lines, with an additional control
      after statistical screening, so that period is skipped if not enough data
      remain after the screening, also including native missing data such as -9999.
    - Refinement: improved format and function calls related to exception
      handling and corresponding output messages.
    - Refinement: Simplified ShowDailyAdvancement and introduced advancement
      marks on output, to allow for GUI estimates of processing time.
    - Refinement: revised the text displayed when running engines with option -h.
    - Refinement: in "filelist_by_ext", anticipated exception handling if no
      files are found in folder.
    - Refinement: proper setting of FileEndReached in ReadSLTEddySoft and
      ReadSLTEdisol.
    - Refinement: adjusted algorithms to calculated default timelags, which now
      include "tube time", "cell time" and a "safety margin".
    - Refinement: eliminated useless "+1" on both sides of a "greater than" test,
      in subs importing all binary files (TOB1, generic binary).
    - Refinement: eliminated useless "+1" on both sides of a "greater than" test,
      in subs importing SLT files.
    - Refinement: Removed the usage of auxiliary folder ..\mod in both RPP and
      FCC projects, to ease and streamline the port to other OS.
    - Refinement: in case of space separation in raw file with non-numeric field,
      defaults to considering multiple consecutive separations as only one.
    - Refinement: calculation of cutoff frequencies and dependence cutoff/RH
      when data for very few RH classes are available.
    - Refinement: Moved definition of 'null' spectra from fx to common module.
    - Refinement: moved function NameMatchesTemplate into
      src_common/dir_sub.f90 file.
    - Refinement: eliminated useless output 'Verifying time series integrity'
      during planar fit data import.
    - Refinement: corrected the spelling of subroutine ShrinkString.

    Minor update mostly for bug fixing and refinement.

    Engine

      speeds up processing of long TOB1 files (typical use case).
    - Fixed: bug that was causing storage fluxes to be identically zero in most
        use cases.
    - Fixed: file in src_common was importing module rp-related (did not cause
        computation issues).
    - Refinement: modified absolute limits statistical test defaults as follows:
        * Minimum sonic temperature set to -40 C (was -20 C).
        * Maximum CO2 set to 900 ppm (was 600 ppm).
    - Refinement: fixes to ranges of accepted biomet values:
        * Changed minimum ambient pressure to 40 kPa (was 80 kPa).
        * Made all interval min/max closed instead of open,
          most important for RH, to include values 0 and 100.

    - Fixed: bug causing the spectral assessment to fail if a large number of spectra
        files were to be used.
    - Refinement: changed units of ET fluxes in the full output file. New units is

    Minor update that fixes a GUI bug related to the retrieval of declination correction
    for magnetic north from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
    (NOAA) website. The update corrects an error that occurs when the website is
    unavailable.

4.1.0 (2012-11-01)
      For a complete list of new features see:
      http://envsupport.licor.com/help/EddyPro4/Default.htm#Whats_New.htm

    - New features
      - A new spectral correction scheme based on Fratini et al. (2012),
        specifically designed for closed-path systems, but applicable to any EC setup.
      - A new angle-of-attack correction algorithm, implemented after Nakai and
        Shimoyama (2012).

    - Improvements
      - Usage of "previous results" to dramatically reduce program execution time.
      - Binary SLT files containing more than 6 variables can now be processed with
        EddyPro.
      - Usage of external biomet data files, not anymore limited to 18,000 data records.
        In version 4.1, biomet files can contain any number of data records.
      - Express processing uses the new angle-of-attack correction algorithm from
        Nakai and Shimoyama (2012) rather than the correction from Nakai et al. (2006)
        used in previous versions.

    - Major bug fixes
      - Automatic time lag optimization
        - Bug description
          The bug is found in the "Automatic time lag optimization" procedure
          (Advanced Settings >> Processing Options >> Time lag compensation"). The bug
          is such that time lags assessed for H2O (if this gas is treated in flux
          computation) are erroneously used also for CO2 or CH4. Selection of an
          erroneous time lag results in flux underestimates: the more the used time
          lag deviates from the real one, the more fluxes are underestimated.
        - Who is affected
          Anyone who used the "Automatic time lag optimization" option for flux
          computation is likely to be affected. However, the severity of the effects
          changes according to the gas analyzer in use. For open-path analyzers (e.g.,
          LI-7500A), the bias if most likely negligible, if present at all. For
          enclosed-path analyzers (e.g., LI-7200), the bias is probably detectable but
          still negligible, because time lags of H2O do not deviate dramatically from
          those of CO2, especially if conditions of low relative humidity (<50-60%,
          typical of daytime). In these analyzers, effects are further minimized
          if a short (< 1 m) and/or heated or insulated sampling line was used. For
          closed-path analyzers with sampling lines longer than 2 m (e.g., with an
          LI-7000 or an LI-6262), the effects are likely to be relevant and we thus
          recommend to recalculate fluxes using version 4.1.
        - Who is not affected
          All users who ran EddyPro in "Express mode", or those who did not use the
          "Automatic timelag optimization" option are not affected by this bug.
        - Note
          We recommend using the "Automatic timelag optimization" procedure especially for
          closed-path setups featuring medium and long (> 3-4 m) sampling lines. The bug
          notified here was fixed and the correct procedure is available in this release
          (EddyPro 4.1).

      - Calculation of average CH4 mole fractions and mixing ratios from LI-7700
        - Bug description
          Fixed a bug that caused the band-broadening correction to not get applied in the
          calculation of average CH4 concentrations. Note that this did not affect fluxes
          at any extent, as the band-broadening correction was applied on fluxes
          separately in 4.0. The effects of this bug were visible especially in conditions
          of very low ambient pressure with respect to normal values.

    - Other bug fixes
      - Fixed bug that caused the program to crash when the number of files selected for
        planar fit calculations were more than the maximum allowed (3,000). The bug was
        fixed and this maximum value was increased to 18,000.
      - Fixed bug that caused the calculation of maximal wind speed to fail in case of
        existence of any raw data records with at least one wind components set to -9999
        (EddyPro's internal error code). Most often this bug resulted in a maximal wind
        speed of 17318.7 m/s, that was the result of wind speed calculated from 3 wind
        components set to -9999. This bug had no affect on flux results.
      - Fixed bug that caused the cross-wind correction of sonic temperature to be
        calculated erroneously for individual data records that have any wind component
        set to -9999. This bug resulted in implausible values for sonic temperature and
        thus either in fluxes set to -9999, or to extremely spiky fluxes. Note that for
        most anemometers the cross-wind correction is applied in the firmware, so there
        is no need to apply it at processing time with EddyPro.
      - Fixed bug that caused the header of the "full output" file to be erroneous when
        using the option "Use standard output format".
      - Fixed bug that caused the night-time/daytime indication in the "full output" file
        to fail in some circumstances.
      - Fixed a bug in the Random uncertainty estimate that caused the software to
        crash with an "Out of memory" error message.

    - GUI changes
      - Added a general "Restore Default Values" button to restore all the Advanced
        Settings to the Default (express) Settings.
      - Added many constraints between fields to help fill out the Metadata File Editor
        tables.
      - Improved management of previous versions of Project and Metadata files for
        backward compatibility.
      - Added a Software Version field in the Metadata File Editor IRGA table.
      - Added an automatic "Detect Dataset Dates" button for the raw data files.
      - Prevented wheel mouse scrolling on setting controls.
      - Improved management at low resolution displays.
      - Added automatic saving on sub-dialogs exit.
      - Fixed opening associated .eddypro project files when double clicking the file.
      - Added button to clear the output console.
      - Improved guided mode information messages.
      - Fixed many minor GUI bugs.

4.0.0 (2012-04-25)
    - New features
      - Support for biomet data (biological and meteorological data) collected
        from ancillary sensors.
      - Metadata Retriever tool to compile all site metadata from GHG files
        into a single metadata file that can be edited or viewed.
      - Planar Fit tool customization with graphical controls.
      - Time Lag Optimization tool now supports automatic time lag optimization
        to account for time lags.
      - Random Uncertainty estimation tool.

3.0.1 (2012-03-12, not released)
    - Major bug fixes
      - Kljun et al. 2004 footprint estimation: Previous version used
        measurement height (z). Update uses the difference between the measurement
        height and displacement height (z-d).
      - Initialization of latitude, longitude and altitude when using
        dynamic metadata file.
      - Sampling line flow-rate calculation when average flow rate from
        high-frequency data is used to initialize nominal, minimum and maximum
        time lags.
      - Spectral assessment output file when selected correction method is
        Horst (1997).
      - A bug prevented runs without any spectral corrections applied.
      - Refined handling of the "Select a subperiod" option.
      - GUI dialog windows. Users in the previous version could potentially
        loose settings in the dialog windows. When a user clicks on a button
        to enter data, such as "Settings..." next to Generic binary, they can
        enter their data, save the project, close the project, re-open it,
        re-open the widget and their data will not be visible in the GUI. The
        data is still there but not appearing. If the user saves the project, the
        information will be overwritten. If they select cancel, it will remain as
        it was before.
      - Improved project and data selection pages by adding page splitters.
      - Fixed behavior with the cross-wind correction checkbox in relation to
        being properly deactivated with the Master Anemometer in data selection
        page.
      - Improved multiple items in the raw file description. The measurement type
        "Molar Density" was changed to "Molar/Mass Density." The option "Raw File
        Settings" is now deactivated when SLT file types are selected. The algorithm
        for detection of valid minimum variable settings was corrected for "Speed
        of Sound." The saving and reloading of the correct field separator values
        was fixed.
      - Fixed and improved multiple items in the advanced settings. The [%] unit
        was removed from the "Steadiness of Horizontal Wind" feature. Under the
        processing options, the behavior of the widgets for "compensate density
        fluctuations" and "add instrument sensible heat components" was corrected
        to gray and disabled when appropriate.
      - Fixed the error label default number to correctly display in the project
        file as -9999. (Advanced settings/output files).
      - Fixed the default setting under Advanced Settings/Output Files so "Build
        continuous dataset" is unchecked.
      - Match the default unchecked state of Metadata output checkbox with
        project file setting and remove the incorrect association with Full Output.
      - Fixed incomplete offline help system.
      - Fixed the Guided mode for the Metadata File Editor algorithm to properly
        assess the fixed unit of measurement for both input and output
        relationships.

3.0.0 (2012-02-06)
    - Final official release of introducing the Advanced Settings.

3.0.0 Beta (2011-12-14)
    - First public release of 3.0 Beta. This version introduces the Advanced Settings.

2.3.0 (2011-07-20)
    - Major bug fixes
      - An error occurred in the calculation of corrected fluxes if the
        N2O analyzer was a closed-path one, while the CH4 analyzer was open-path
        or CH4 was not present at all. The bug resulted in corrected fluxes of
        N2O equal to -9999 (that is, if your N2O fluxes are not -9999, they are
        not affected by this bug).
      - Definition of "relative separations". No impact on calculations,
        only on the output metadata.
      - Control on use of cell temperature (fixed re-initialization of column
        information)
      - In statistical tests (Spike count/removal and Amplitude Resolution/Drop
        Out) length of implied windows modified so as to scale with the length
        of the averaging period.
    - Improvements
      - Handling of situations where H2O readings are not available
        (air density, momentum flux).
      - Control over peculiar situations in Fluxes23 (WPL section).
      - Introduced support for TOB1 format "FP2"
      - Introduced detection of very implausible values in the raw
        files, and their substitution with error codes.
      - Error codes in raw files (-9999) are no longer modified
        during conversions of raw units into EddyPro units
      - Better handling of situation when all GHG files have invalid
        metadata or are corrupted.
      - Better handling of the computations exit codes

2.2.0 (2011-06-20)
    - Major bug fixes
      - Fixed bug concerning fluxes calculated from CH4 and N2O mole fraction
        measurements from closed path systems. The bug affected also fluxes
        calculated with CO2 mole fractions, if the paired H2O was measured as
        either molar density or mixing ratio. In all cases, the bug resulted
        in flux values =-9999 (that is, if your fluxes are not -9999, they
        are not affected by this bug).
      - Fixed Altitude field zeroing in the Metadata editor.
      - Changed the docking policies of the Tips dock: now it's movable and
        floatable top and bottom and it could also be tabbed with the Console.
      - Changed the dimension policy of the Tips dock: now it's expandable.
      - Fixed misspellings.
      - Used native dialog for the 'Save metadata as' button.
      - GUI code cleaned up.

2.1.4 (2011-06-02)
      - Fixed incorrect filtering of CH4 vars in the Processing page, in case of
        Generic gas analyzer.
      - Added the changelog file viewer in the About dialog.

2.1.3 (2011-05-31)
      - Fixed the SoS to temperature conversion.
      - More detailed diagnostic on the metadata file validation at console.
      - Quality flags recalculated according to Mauder and Foken (2004), which
        should eliminate most (possibly not all) the -9999 in the quality flags
      - Added CHANGELOG.txt to source and installer packages.

2.1.2 (2011-05-18, not released)
      - Fixed problem of Access denied authorization during the processing of the
        data.

2.1.1 (2011-04-26)
    - Fixed typo about the unit of measure of the Raw Data Description table
      (umol/mol^3, instead of umol/m^3).

2.1.0 (2011-04-21)
    - Optimized GUI for support low resolution screens (up to 800x600 px).
    - Rearranged widgets between Project page and Processing page (ID moved to
      Processing).
    - Added input dialog for the ID field.
    - Improved look&feel of Combo box and Spin box.
    - Changed policies for scrollbar and scrolling behavior into the tables.
    - Changed default value in some table fields.
    - Changed from QByteArrays to QString where there is the possibilities of
      weak conversions.
    - Fixed selection of None variables into Processing page combo's when there
      are already some variable.
    - Updated the manual.

2.0.0 (2011-04-05)
    - First public release of EddyPro (Express version only).
